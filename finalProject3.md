”Pack a bag. We’re going to the E.R.” It was a normal Wednesday in March and the weather was finally getting warm. Teachers had meetings that morning so school didn’t start until 9:25 a.m. But before I went to school and water polo practice, I had a doctor’s appointment. I was going in for a pretty normal shoulder injury, just some wear and tear from swimming. My doctor wanted to make sure there was no serious damage so he ordered a few x-rays. By the time the evaluation is over it’s 9:40a.m., so he told us to  leave once we got the pictures done. I get the x-rays taken and head home before going to school. He told me to lay off water polo for 2 weeks and to wear my arm in a sling. I run inside to grab one from one of my past injuries and hop back in the car to go to school, but my mom’s on the phone, and talking medical. Already? I thought, something is wrong. What could be this wrong with my shoulder? My mind was racing, what was wrong with me? No doctor calls that quick unless you have a serious issue. And boy, did I have an issue. My right lung had collapsed. I needed to go to the hospital. We get to the hospital and soon enough they’re stabbing me in the chest to reinflate my lung. After three days of recovery and being bored out of my mind I was finally free to go home. I got out on Saturday, and spring break had just begun. After talking with the doctors, they said I wasn’t allowed any physical activities for 4 weeks,  and that my water polo season was over. I stayed home for most of break just relaxing and getting my head on straight. After break was over I went to my first practice since getting out of the hospital. After saying hi to all my teammates and coaches, checking in with everyone seeing how I was doing, it hit me. How much I would miss exhausting myself everyday, playing the most challenging but fun sport. I was crushed that I couldn’t play my newly adopted but favorite sport. I felt useless; but I realized that I wasn’t totally useless. I decided to help in anyway possible. Whether it was help coach the freshman goalies so that they too, can make Big Saves,  making sure we had all the equipment we would need for that practice, or  yelling at JV to keep swimming. But the one thing I did most was day-dream; day-dream about getting back into the water, making extraordinary plays, making game winning saves. This lust to get back in the water ate away at me for 4 weeks, all building up to the day. It was finally time to get back in. I had a giant grin on my face walking into the locker room, telling my teammates, “I’m back” in the voice of an excited 10 year old. I jump in, I get a cold chill down my back, man it felt good. I begin the warm-up and I’m hit like a brick wall; I haven’t swam in a month and my body is screaming, everything hurt. We hadn’t even begun the work-outs and I was exhausted. But I was determined to get back into shape. I grabbed the heaviest medicine ball and began treading it out of the water. I felt my knees begin to cry, what did they do to deserve this punishment? I kept going until I felt like I was gonna drown. And I did it again. It felt so good, the rush of endorphins, being around my friends, exercising again. But it was just the beginning of a long road to recovery.
