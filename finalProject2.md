One of the best decisions in High School I made was joining the Water Polo team. I decided to join my Sophomore year after not making the Baseball team. I joined the Swim team too that year, which helped push me to my decision to join the Polo team. I joined the team two weeks into the season, as I had sprained my ankle playing basketball. I had never seen a Polo game and really had no idea what the sport was, but my swim friends who all played Polo convinced me to join and that I should play goalie because they needed a better goalie and because of my long arms.

My first game was the day after my first practice. I still had no idea what the hell I was doing, but I played the entire 2nd half. While we ended up losing the game, I gave up the same amount of goals as the other goalie, so I considered it a success.

The rest of the season went well, I got a lot stronger, I could tread water better, and I figured out how to play Water Polo. I eventually took over as the main goalie, as I had become much better than the other goalie. The team did well too, we did well in tournaments and made it to the conference championship where we ended up losing. It was a great season.

Water Polo, while not my first love which is Baseball, found a place in my heart. It was a great time with my friends and it made me a better, and stronger person.
